# AUTONOMOUS-FOX LABORATORIES

***Autonomous-Fox Laboratories (AF Labs) is an independent research group advancing deep learning and statistical approaches for modelling the behaviours of financial markets.

Our work focuses on developing deep learning models that extract structure from complex, noisy data — particularly in settings where useful information is scarce and unstable.  
By advancing methods in representation and contextual learning, we aim to capture the underlying organisation of market behaviour rather than just its surface patterns.

### What we do
- **Representation Learning for Markets** — uncovering latent structure in financial time series  
- **Neural State-Space Models** — learning discrete and continuous dynamical behaviour  from data  
- **Causal and Hierarchical Generative Models** — building architectures that explain, not just predict  
- **Systematic Arbitrage Research** — applying learning systems to trading financial markets

### Why “the Fox”?
The fox is intelligent and opportunistic — a scavenger that survives by sifting through garbage to find value where none seems to exist. That’s how we see machine learning in the markets: not a blunt tool for prediction, but a keen observer, hunting for signal buried deep in the noise.

Most of our research and development repositories are private while under development or in active use.  
Public releases, documentation, and selected open-source components will appear here as projects reach production readiness and papers are published.
